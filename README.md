# A-Practical-Convex-Approach-to-Capacitor-Bank-Allocation-in-Distribution-Networks
This study addresses the problem of optimal location and sizing of fixed-step capacitor banks in electrical distribution networks.  The main objective is to reduce active power losses and improve the voltage profile of the system.To achieve this, a convex optimization (SOCP) techniques.
